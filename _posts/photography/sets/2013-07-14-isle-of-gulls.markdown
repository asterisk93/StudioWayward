This build is the culmination of over a month and a half of work, the brunt of which was completed in September. The original deadline for online entries in the 2017 Gunpla Builders World Cup had been set for the end of September, but a few days before the 30th, Bandai officially announced that they had extended the submission deadline to Halloween. This gave me time to add the floating cable effects and fine-tune the shrapnel. In total, parts from 7 different model kits have gone into the creation of this build.
