The year is 2013. What begins as a charming family outing soon turns to utter chaos as they disembark the Toronto Island ferry, only to find that there are no people. There are no ferries back to the shore. There are no runners or bikers, swimmers or picnic-goers. The Pizza Pizza is closed. The island has been overrun with seagulls. Only time will tell what fate awaits the family on the ISLE OF GULLS (2003)
