It was a treat to be able to revisit one of my favorite gundam designs. The original 1/100 Astray Red Frame was one of the first model kits I'd ever built, albeit quite poorly, almost a decade ago, so I'm happy to have been able to give it a proper go this time. Weathered in black, he stands on a scratchbuilt balsa wood platform, which I carved up to look like jagged stone.
