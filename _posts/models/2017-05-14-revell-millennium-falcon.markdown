My first foray into sci-fi spaceship models from the world of sci-fi robot models, The Revell Snaptite Millennium Falcon was a quick and cheap model found at my local Michaels. While certain details aren't to my liking (the rectangular new-trilogy standard-issue dish instead of the circular aftermarket one Lando lost), there was enough surface detail on the kit itself for me to have a field day with with the paneling and the detailing overtop of what was more or less blank white plastic that lacked the trademark "Star Wars" patina. It makes for a nice display piece on a stand that I threw together out of balsa and plywood, but I've got far bigger plans for the Millennium Falcon, so expect to see more Falcon models in the future!
