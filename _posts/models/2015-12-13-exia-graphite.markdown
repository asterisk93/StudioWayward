This particular model kit is a survivor from old times. I finished the initial build back in January of 2011, and have slowly been adding to it/experimenting with it over the years. The wear on the lower body was my first attempt at some semblance of weathering using pencil graphite, and the gouges on the shield, a first at physical battle damage using a file and sandpaper. The paint-job on the display base was a fairly successful experiment to simulate marble and brass-like surfaces using paint and ink. The last of my early model kits to survive constant moves and storage, Exia saw the shelf, the box, and the workbench multiple times as my definition of "a finished model" evolved with experience. As of now, I don't plan to do much work on this kit going forward, and so it has been indefinitely shelved/completed with the last modifications taking place prior to May of 2017.
