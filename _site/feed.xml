Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Spolied by the simple ‘sandwich’ style, precolored car models of my youth, this intricate love-labour of paint, cement, paint, gloss, and more paint, took the better part of a month to complete, with many setbacks and revisions along the way. The body was painted with Krylon and Testors rattlecan sprays, and the more intricate details I brushpainted on by hand using Tamiya acrylics. All in all, a very fun project, and I’d love to attempt more model cars in the future with better equipment and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This model was bought and built with the intention of being a Christmas gift for a close friend, but ended up also giving me the gift of adventure with my first in-depth model car project.

I finished the initial build back in January of 2011, and have slowly been adding to it/experimenting with it over the years. The wear on the lower body was my first attempt at some semblance of weathering using pencil graphite, and the gouges on the shield, a first try at physical battle damage using a file and sandpaper. The paint-job on the display base was a fairly successful experiment to simulate marble and brass-like surfaces using paint and ink. The last of my early model kits to survive constant moves and storage, Exia saw the shelf, the box, and the workbench multiple times as my definition of “a finished model” evolved with experience. As of now, I don’t plan to do much work on this kit going forward, and so it has been indefinitely shelved/completed with the last modifications taking place prior to May of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This particular model kit is a survivor from old times.
