			<span>As the sole creative talent behind <a href="http://studiowayward.com/">StudioWayward.com</a>, I have been responsible for all aspects of the site's aesthetic components as well as its functionality. A curated collection of my graphic work for Studio Wayward can be seen on display in the <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/studio-wayward/shop?asc=u">Wayward Redbubble T-shirt Store</a>. CSS styling on all three of the Studio Wayward sites was done from scratch, and all of the content, photography, and writing contained therein is of my own creation.</span>

			<span>As a Fido sales rep, my duties included holding a store key and the safe codes for use in the store opening/closing routines, and general retail operations such as conducting POS transactions, inventory counts, EOD excel reports, EOD cash deposits. My technological expertise was useful when managing and maintaining the demo display units, installing store fixtures, diagnosing the source of customer device problems, and if possible, repairing them. I provided exemplary customer service, both in person when addressing customer issues and concerns, and over the phone while helping customers remotely sort out device issues and internet installations.</span>

			<span>I've repaired and maintained many laptop and desktop computers since high school, including the partial disassembly of laptops to swap out components like HDDs or keyboards, or to repair internal faults like loose power connectors/ribbon cables. I've also fully disassembled laptops into their base components to prevent the progression of water damage. I'm familiar with desktop maintenance and component installation (swapping case fans, upgrading ram, installing additional drives, reapplication of thermal paste, thorough dustings, proper cable management, etc.), and have built many customized desktops (including my own) from either self-sourced or client requested components.</span>

			<span>Having been an occasional-turned-staff contributor, I formally joined The Howl in 2014 in the position of Arts and Entertainment Editor, and my experience curating the A&E and Fiction sections made me a good fit to take over Leadership of the paper the following year as Editor-in-Chief. As head of the paper, my responsibilities included editorial duties such as reviewing all submissions to ensure adherence to quality standards and Howl principles, as well as tech/webmaster duties, such as by migrating the Howl online to wwhowl.net, designing graphics and styling the site with CSS, and rebuilding previously abandoned parts into a functioning desktop workstation for use in the Howl office.</span>
